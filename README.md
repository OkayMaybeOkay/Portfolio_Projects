# Portfolio Projects
This repository is to show case all the code I have worked on and completed!


## Here are some of my projects
Job_Tracker Project:
Used to write in jobs you are interested in, save them into a CSV file, and then be
able to read, edit, or delete the CSV Contents.

Research_Project
In conjuction with Cabe Robertson, we created all the code in the research project folder
in order to learn about the decoding processes of corrupted keywords.

Spotify_API_Project
In conjuction with Millie Salazar, we created all the code in the Spotify API project folder
in order to put artists against each other and compare them in a sort of "battle".
